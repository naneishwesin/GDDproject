This builds on the **Survival Shooter** tutorial project from Unity. It is
provided as a part of the instructional content at AIE Seattle.

The original copy of the Survival Shooter was originally available for free from
Unity Technologies on [Unity Learn][U3D_SurvivalShooter] and licensed under

## Differences From Tutorial Project

Some differences are present when compared to the original tutorial project:

Property        | Original                           | Latest
----------------|------------------------------------|------------------------
Version         | Unity 5                            | Unity 20XX (see [Building](#building))
Render Pipeline | Built-in (BIRP)                    | Universal (URP)
Lighting        | Face Light Only                    | Flashlight + Face Light
Global Lighting | Single Directional Light + Ambient | Ambient Only

> :question: **Why use the Universal Render Pipeline?**  
> The Survival Shooter project as originally released for Unity 4.6 was not
> designed as an ultra high-fidelity experience.
>
> To target scalability, the Universal Render Pipeline was chosen for its modest
> feature-set and resource load.
